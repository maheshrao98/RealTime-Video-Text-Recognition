# RealTime_Video_Text_Recognition
Tesseract JS is well known as a npm module that can be used for reading text from images but one of the least talked ability of Tesseract JS is the real time video text recognition feature. With this feature, you can directly read the text from a video feed that is running such as a live recording. I have build this feature in React.
